# MindMap App

A lightweight mind map editor built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite. It supports node creation, editing, dragging, collapsing, automatic layout, a style panel, and JSON/PNG import and export. The project is suitable as a demo or as an extensible component for further development.

**Key Features**
- Create, edit, and delete nodes; drag nodes to move them; collapse and expand branches.
- Automatic tree layout, plus canvas zoom, pan, and center controls.
- A right-side style panel for node appearance and canvas configuration.
- JSON import/export and PNG export (using html2canvas).

**Tech Stack**
- Vue 3 + TypeScript
- Vite (development and build)
- html2canvas (for PNG export)

## Project Structure (brief)
- `index.html`: application HTML entry
- `src/main.ts`: Vue app mount entry
- `src/App.vue`: root component, composes the toolbar, canvas, and style panel
- `src/components/`: core UI components (`MindMapCanvas.vue`, `MindMapNode.vue`, `Toolbar.vue`, `StylePanel.vue`, etc.)
- `src/composables/`: composable hooks (`useMindMap.ts`, `useExport.ts`, `useKeyboard.ts`)
- `src/types/index.ts`: type definitions
- `public/`: static assets

## Main Components & Developer Notes
- `MindMapCanvas`: canvas rendering and drawing of nodes and links; handles zoom, pan, and drag interactions.
- `MindMapNode`: single-node presentation and editing controls; responds to select, edit, and collapse actions.
- `Toolbar`: actions such as new, import, export, add, delete, and auto-layout.
- `StylePanel`: edit the style of the selected node and canvas settings.

Overview of composables:
- `useMindMap`: core state management and operations (root, selectedNode, addChild, addSibling, deleteNode, autoLayout, zoomCanvas, etc.).
- `useExport`: JSON import/export and PNG export (uses html2canvas).
- `useKeyboard`: global keyboard shortcut handling (e.g. Tab/Enter/Delete/arrow navigation).

Type information: core types live in `src/types/index.ts`, including the node structure, node style (`NodeStyle`), and export data formats.

## Export / Import Notes
- PNG export is generated by `html2canvas`; large or complex diagrams may be limited by browser memory. If export fails, try reducing the scale or simplifying node styles.
- JSON import should match the format exported by the app; importing will replace the current canvas data.

## Development & Extension Suggestions
- Components are separated by responsibility and can be replaced or extended in `src/components` to add functionality.
- `useMindMap` exposes most business APIs, making it easy to call from outside or to unit test.
